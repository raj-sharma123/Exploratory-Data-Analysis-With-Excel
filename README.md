# Exploratory Data Analysis With Excel of Titanic Dataset
## Introduction

The **RMS Titanic** was a British passenger liner that tragically sank on **April 15, 1912**, during its maiden voyage from **Southampton**, England, to **New York City**, after colliding with an iceberg. The **Titanic dataset** is a widely recognized dataset in the data science community and is frequently used for exploratory data analysis and machine learning practice.

This dataset contains detailed information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including personal attributes (such as age, gender, and name), travel details (such as ticket fare, class, and port of embarkation), and an important outcome label indicating whether or not each passenger **survived** the disaster.

In this project, we will conduct a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights related to passenger survival based on different features.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of 12 columns:
1. **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger.
2. **Survived:** Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3. **Pclass:** Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
4. **Name:** Name of the passenger.
5. **Sex:** Gender of the passenger.
6. **Age:** Age of the passenger in years.
7. **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
8. **Parch:****** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
9. **Ticket:** Ticket number.
10. **Fare:** Passenger fare (is in Pre-1970 British Pounds).
11. **Cabin:** Cabin number.
12. **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

## Summary of Dataset
 * The dataset includes **891** rows, each representing a passenger.
 * The **"Survived"** column indicates whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.
 * The **"Pclass"** column indicates the class of the passenger, which is a proxy for socio-economic status (1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower).
 * Missing values are present in the "Age", "Cabin", and "Embarked" columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 * **Survival Rate Analysis:** Analyzing how survival rates differ based on features like class (Pclass), sex, age, and embarked port.
 * **Visualizations:** Create histograms, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots and treemap charts to explore relationships between features.
